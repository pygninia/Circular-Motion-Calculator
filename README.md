Circle Motion Calculator
Welcome to the Circle Motion Calculator project! This is a Java-based tool that calculates various properties of circular motion, including speed, velocity, acceleration, force, period, frequency, and more. It uses Java Swing for the graphical user interface, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience.

Features
Set Circle Radius: Define the radius of the circle.
Calculate Speed, Velocity, Acceleration, Force: Easily compute these properties based on the circle's radius and other user inputs.
Calculate Period and Frequency: Derive the period and frequency based on angular velocity and other parameters.
User-Friendly Interface: The program uses Java Swing for an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to guide users through calculations.
Trivia Quiz: Test your knowledge with a set of trivia questions related to circular motion and physics.

Steps to Install:
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/circle-motion-calculator.git
Open the project in your Java IDE or navigate to the project directory.

Run the program:

Compile and run the project using your IDE or from the command line.
The program will launch with a graphical interface that will guide you through setting up the circle's radius and performing calculations.
Usage
When you run the program, you'll be presented with several options to choose from. These include setting the circle radius, and calculating properties like speed, velocity, acceleration, force, period, and frequency.

Set Circle Radius: Input the radius of the circle.
Speed: Calculate the speed using the radius and period.
Velocity: Calculate tangential velocity from angular velocity.
Acceleration: Compute the centripetal acceleration using speed.
Force: Calculate the centripetal force using mass and speed.
Period: Calculate the period based on angular velocity.
Frequency: Calculate the frequency using the period.
Trivia Quiz:
At the end of your calculations, you can participate in a trivia quiz to test your knowledge on circular motion and physics! Answer the questions to get a score and an estimated IQ based on your performance.

Common Issues and Fixes
Error: "Invalid input. The radius cannot be zero or negative."
Solution: Ensure that the radius you enter is a positive number greater than zero.
Error: "Invalid input. Please enter a valid number for the period/velocity/etc."
Solution: Double-check that you're entering a valid number and not a string or special characters.
Error: "Please set the circle radius first."
Solution: Before calculating other properties like speed or velocity, you need to define the circle radius.
